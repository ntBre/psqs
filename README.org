* Description
  This is a crate for Rust interfaces to quantum chemistry programs (like
  Molpro, Gaussian, and MOPAC) and queuing systems like Slurm and PBS. It
  contains traits defining the high-level behavior of these =Program=s and
  =Queue=s, as well as concrete implementations for the aforemention programs.
  The list of currently supported programs is as follows:
** Programs
   - [X] MOPAC
   - [ ] Molpro
   - [ ] Gaussian
** Queuing systems
   - [X] Slurm
   - [ ] PBS
